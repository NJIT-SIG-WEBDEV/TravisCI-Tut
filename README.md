Working with Webpack

Webpack is the new leader in Module Loading Management System. It also added functionalities to use plugins, which automatically organizes, uglifies, minifies, and orders your code among other things. This combined the workload of requireJs and Grunt into one, which is easier for the developers. 

It is also the best module loader to use with React, which is the fastest growing MVC on the stack.
